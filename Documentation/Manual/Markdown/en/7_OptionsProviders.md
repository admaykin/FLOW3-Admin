# OptionsProviders

An Options Provider creates the List of Options for the SingleRelation and MultipleRelation Widgets. Currently there is just the Default implementation which creates the Options Using the ID and String Representation of the Object. But for Example the PolicyOptionsProvider ensures that there are all needed Options as Policy available when the Roles Object is loaded
